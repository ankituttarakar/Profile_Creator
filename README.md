# Profile Portal
# üöÄ Project Overview
The PESU Profile Portal is a simple, single-page web application that allows users to create and preview their personal profile. Built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the portal features a clean, responsive design. It demonstrates a basic front-end workflow where user input in a form is dynamically rendered in a live preview section, making it an excellent example for learning core web development concepts.

# ‚ú® Features
Live Preview: As you type or select information in the input form, the Preview section updates in real-time.

Dynamic Clock: A clock in the top bar displays the current date and time, updating every second.

Input Validation: The form uses HTML5 validation to ensure required fields like name, email, and a 10-digit phone number are filled out correctly before submission.

Image Upload: Users can upload a photo, which is then displayed dynamically in the preview as a circular avatar.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts seamlessly for different screen sizes, stacking the input and preview sections vertically on smaller devices.
